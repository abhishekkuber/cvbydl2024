# CS4245 Seminar Computer Vision By Deep Learning

Code for [reproduction](https://hackmd.io/L82_xZI4QA-QO7GojqPxeQ?view) of the paper "Let there be Color! Joint End-to-end Learning of Global and Local Image Priors for Automatic Image Colorization with Simultaneous Classification". 


## Run
1. Use the [original dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/xuhangc/filmset) and download it 
2. For the original architecture, run ```main.ipynb```
3. If you want to reduce the number of parameters like we have done in the blog, divide the number of channels for the convolution layers by powers of two.
